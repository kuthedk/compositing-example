20:02 < friggle> Cheery: so, let's say you want to support a hardware cursor. 
                 The way Dom suggested to do it is you vc_dispmanx_element_add 
                 to a certain layer. Then, as you update it you get an update 
                 handle with  vc_dispmanx_update_start(0);
20:03 < friggle> Cheery: then vcdispmanx_element_remove your cursor, then 
                 vc_dispmanx_element_add again (with a new dest_rect)
20:03 < friggle> then vc_dispmanx_update_submit (this remove and add is atomic 
                 because it occurred between and update_start/update_submit)

20:04 < friggle> looked to me like yo ucould 
                 vc_dispmanx_element_change_attributes instead, but Dom said he 
                 preferred that way for some reason
